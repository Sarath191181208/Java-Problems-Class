### GUI Problems

18. Programs using JavaFX canvas.
19. The following JavaFX GUI counter contains 3 controls (or components): a Label, a Text Field and a Button.
    Clicking the button increases the count displayed in the text field.
20. Write a JavaFX program that works as a simple calculator.
    Use a grid layout to arrange buttons for the digits and for the +, -, \*, % operations.
    Add a text field to display the result. Handle any possible exceptions like divide by zero.
21. Write a JavaFX program that creates a menu.

### Digital Assignment

1. Develop a java program to implement List interface by using stack class and linkedlist classes. (It should include all the methods of List interface).
2. Develp a java program to implement Set interface by using TreeSet class and EnumSet class.
3. Develp a java program to implement queue interface by using ArrayDeque class and LinkedList class and priority queue class.

### Assignment Problems

- Questions on Generics:

  22. Create two classes called CompAEmp and CompBEmp extending Emp class. Create a
      generic class called MyEmployeeUtil, which defines utilities to perform employee
      functions irrespective of which comapany emp belogns too. This class accepts
      subclasses of Emp. Compare the salary of two employees using MyEmployeeUtil
      class.

  23. Create a class Complex which has real and imaginary values represents the
      numeric values. The class has one parametrized constructor to initialize real and
      imaginary part of complex number. The generic class Complex implements in-built
      interface Comparable. Write the java program to find bigger complex number from
      the pair of complex number using comparable interface.

  24. Bob want to search a particular number in available list of arranged numeric
      numbers. Will you help him to find a numeric number using java program with the
      concept of generic?

- Questions on Thread:

  25. Creates the 4 threads and achieve the synchronization among threads for following
      tasks.

  - a. It accepts the multi-digit number
  - b. Performs the sum of digits of given number until it gets the single digit
    number
  - c. Calculate the factorial of number which is returned by task b above task.
    Note: For each task define the separate methods.
